Project for C# Tuesday Class

For this project I want to test out an idea from family.  The Tandem Story.

Needed functions:

Players create or add to a story one piece at a time.
Each player submits either a few sentences or a paragraph at a time to build the story.
The story is either fully visible or only the last section visible to the next player.
Each player gets a copy of the story once it's complete.
